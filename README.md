# Multi-Modal Authentication System

A robust, secure, and intelligent authentication system that combines **Face Recognition**, **Voice Authentication**, and **Pin Matching** for multi-layered access control. This project is built to enhance security by ensuring that access is granted only when any two modalities are successfully validated.

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- **Face Recognition** – Verifies user identity using facial features.
- **Voice Recognition** – Confirms user through voice pattern matching.
- **Pin-Based Authentication** – Confirms user through pin matching.
